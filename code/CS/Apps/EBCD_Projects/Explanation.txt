EBCD is Encrypted Binary Control Data

EKV2 is Encryption Key Vault?  Not really sure.

Executable Projects are:

1. EBCD_Builder - Creates named key value pair files as binary data.

2. EBCD_Batch - Creates Resource Files with embedded EBCD data inside it.


Not fully sure how to implement an end-to-end solution where the Resource file is compiled into an app (as of now)
Or how to use the EBCD.bin data in an application from a folder (rather than from a resource file).
