    <h3>What I've Been Building...</h3>
    <p>
       Across the last 10 years I have been building a codebase for the purpose of rapid application development.  My focus has been on the parts of applications
       that are often thought of last.  It is very natural and necessary to focus on the primary/core functions when developing new applications.
       But most all applications have the need of a several "secondary/supporting functions" such as configuration, logging, encryption, serialization, date processing, 
       interfaces to web services and databases, file processing algorithms, messaging, exception handling, email and SMS notifications, modularity, task 
       processing, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Taken as a whole this set of elements can comprise more than 50% of the code in an application - sometime much more.  Most of these functions 
       support some aspect of the "operational function" of the technology, not necessarily the primary "business function".  The primary "business function" pertains to 
       <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">what</span> an application must do.  The "operational function" pertains to 
       <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">how</span> an application accomplishes its primary business function - or how it delivers its value.

        <h5>Reusable C# Libraries</h5>
        </a></header>
      <p>A large set of reusable libraries that provide various types of support for multiple types of applications.  A significant 
         amount of commonly needed application functionality is implemented in the "General Services Library" - Org.GS.</p>

  <p>
     My philosophy is that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">all</span> the business value potential of an application is realized through 
     its <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">operation</span> (when it operates, it produces value, when it's broken no value is being 
     produced, just disruption). Therefore building solid, reusable components that implement the operational aspects of applications is very important part of being 
     able to deliver business value.  And, building it <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">once</span> as reusable components fosters the 
     kind of reuse, that coupled with the willingess to refactor and make fixes in the right place, produces a very solid and nicely architected set of components. 
     This enables the production of high quality applications that are developed fairly rapidly - two things that do not normally go together.
  </p>
  <p>
     It is very common for these "secondary" needs to be built in an ad-hock fashion as a secondary, lower-priority focus of the development process. 
     This typically results in a wide diversity of techniques in solving the the same common set problems or in applications that "do without" some of the
     operational support they should have. This diversity leads to minimal reuse and minmal reuse typically cuts off the opportunity to drive continual 
     improvement, which leads to buggy software.
  </p>
  <p>
     Often I when I start a new job or engagement, I would ask whether any such libraries exist (somebody must have invented the wheel by now) for handling 
     these very common application support needs - because if they do exist I would certainly use them rather the coding something different from scratch and 
     propagating unnecessary variation. But with only one notable exception I never found what I was looking for and ended up needing to create some of these 
     functions (again) from scratch. After having this occur a few times decided that I would simply bring my code with me and give it to the organization or project 
     so that I could stop having to build again these common support functions and could get started building the applications which were the reason they
     hired me. 
  </p>
  <p>
     I have done over a hundred "home projects" (for learning or for a specific purpose) and have done a number of side projects of various sizes across the last
     ten years.  Across this span of time I have continued to build up and perfect this set of reusable components.  Additionally I have 
     also developed a number of "application shells" for desktop applications, Windows Services and WCF web services so I don't have to start from scratch at the 
     higher level either.  And there is a set of commonly needed utilities.  One of the "application shells" (a Generic Task Processing Windows Services) is discussed below.   
  </p><br/>

  <h3>Example - Generic Task Processing Framework</h3>
  <p>
     As an example of an "application shell" which is part of the C# codebase described above, I've placed an architectural overview of a generic task processing framework 
     that I call "TPFX" (Task Processing Framework) in the diagram below. 
  </p>
  <p>
     You can find the code for this service in the WinService folder in the "Apps" top level folder in the repository.  Also in the Apps folder is WinServiceHost, 
     a desktop app that contains all the "child libraries" for the task processing service and serves as a platform for the development and testing of the service.
     Services do not have a user interfaces (they run in the background controlled by the operating system) and are therefore difficult to develop and debug. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Embodying the entire functionality within high-level libraries and running them inside a desktop application (WinServiceHost) allows a user interface "surface" for clicking 
     buttons and other controls and seeing a scrolling log of activity and messages as output.  This allows the actual service, WinService, to be the thinnest wrapper
     between the Service Control Manager of the operating system and the high-level libraries where the controlling algorithms run.  This also makes the entire application
     very portable concering what kind of wrapper it runs in.
  </p>
  <p>
     In addition to the top-level (main-thread-owning) applications, a number of reusable (thread-dependent) components in the "Libs" folder are used.  
     This includes high-level components such as including Org.TSK (implementing the task engine and task dispatcher) and Org.TSK.Business (the business classes 
     related to task processing, scheduling parameterization, etc.).  Additional lower level libraries include Org.TP (base classes and interfaces for task processors), 
     Org.Notify (email and SMS notifications), and as always, at the bottom of the hierarchy is Org.GS (providing a broad array of services - too many to list here, 
     but most are organized into folders under the Org.GS folder if you want an idea) supporting the most common services to all types of applications and 
     mid/lower-level libraries). 
  </p>
  <p>
     In the diagram below the generic and reusable code is represented by everything that is not blue.  The unique task processing modules which are dynamically 
     plugged in at run-time are the items in blue. These "blue modules" are the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">only code that needs 
     to be written</span> to implement a new function (regarless how simple or complex - to this architecture, they are all just "blue modules" that "plug in" 
     to the higher level architecture). What this means is that about 95% of the code is generic and completely reusable. It is also quite well perfected since 
     it has been used, fixed, optimized, etc. repetitively across several years.
  </p>
  <p>
     To implement a new instance of this service, you simply copy the binaries of the service to a new directory, run a PowerShell commmand to create a new Windows Service 
     definition pointing at the main executable, move some "blue modules" (containing the desired business functions) into a subordinate directory so they can be 
     discovered and loaded, update the database with scheduling and any required parameters and notification configurations, update the service's main configuration 
     file to tell the service tasks in the schedule it is responsible for... then simply start the service using the Service Control Manager. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Building new modules can be done very rapidly because they all adhere to a very simple interface and follow a consistent pattern of structure and behavior.  
     You don't have to build anything that surrounds the "blue module": scheduling, parameterization, logging, configuration, exception handling, 
     notifications, a multi-threaded engine and more are all part of the very capable "socket" in which the modules run which is fully reusable and doesn't
     have to know about or be responsible for any business functionality.
  </p> 
  <p>
     With these libraries I can focus on delivering <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">business value</span> instead of building 
     <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">again</span> the necessary <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">operational overhead</span> 
     functions for applications.  And from an operations standpoint (concerning security, stability, reliability, performance, threading and much  more), 
     I like to say (because it has been my objective in building this) "it runs like a refrigerator" - by which I mean, it just sits there and hums, 
     doesn't cause any trouble and simply gets its work done on time. 
  </p> 
  <p> 
     The Task Processing Framework (TPFX) is simply a completly generic and totally reusable framework totally focused on providing business value by 
     enabling business-value-creating modules to be developed quickly and for them to have a solid "run-time home", and also by freeing them from having to worry about,
     or even know about, anything besides each module's specific <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">business-value-providing</span> 
     concerns. Everything else is provided by the framework. All the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">opertional</span> requirements 
     have been covered in a scope that is fully outside the visibiliy and concerns of the business-focused modules. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">This</span> is what I mean what I speak of (application systems) architecture. And this is the kind
    of stuff I am referring to when I talk about technology finding its purpose in being totally focused on providing business value.
