    <h3>What I've Been Building...</h3>
    <p>
       Across the last 10 years I have been building a codebase for the purpose of rapid application development. While I have built numerous applications with this
       codebase, my focus has really been on the building the parts of applications that are typically thought of last.</p>
    <p>It is quite natural and necessary to focus on the primary business functions when developing new applications. But any application that needs
       to be "production grade" requires a robust set of "secondary/supporting functions" in order to operate properly.</p>
    <p>These secondary functions include such things as configuration, logging, encryption, serialization, date processing, 
       interfaces to web services and databases, file processing algorithms, messaging, exception handling, email and SMS notifications, modularity, task 
       processing, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Taken as a whole, providing for this set of capabilities can comprise more than 50% of the final code in an application - sometimes considerably more.  
       These functions can be described as supporting the "operational requirements" of an application, and don't represent the primary "business functions" 
       of an application.  (The primary "business functions" pertain to <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">what</span> an application 
       is intended to do.  Whereas the "operational functions" pertain to <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">how</span> an application 
       accomplishes its primary business function - or in other words, how it delivers its business value.)

        <h5>Reusable C# Libraries</h5>
        </a></header>
      <p>A large set of reusable libraries that provide various types of support for multiple types of applications.  A significant 
         amount of commonly needed application functionality is implemented in the "General Services Library" - Org.GS.</p>

  <p>
     My philosophy is that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">all</span> of the business value potential of an application is realized 
     <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;"></span>through</span> its <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">operation</span>
     - when it operates it produces value, when it's broken no value is produced, only disruption. Therefore, building solid, reusable components that implement the 
     operational aspects of applications is a very important part of being able to deliver business value with technology.  Further, building them 
     <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">once,</span> as reusable components, coupled with the willingess to refactor them as 
     necessary (optimize their structure and performance and make fixes in the right places), produces a solid, well-architected set of components 
     from which applications can be composed rapidly and immediately have excellent operational support. Having a library of such components enables the 
     production of high-quality applications that are developed fairly rapidly - two things that rarely go together.
  </p>
  <p>
     It is very common for these "operational" needs to be built in an ad-hock fashion as a secondary, lower-priority focus of the application development process. 
     This typically results in a wide diversity of techniques being used to solve the the same regularly occurring set problems. In practice, many applications 
     end up simply "doing without" some of the operational support they should have. This diversity of approach when solving common problems leads to minimal reuse. 
     And, minmal reuse essentially cuts off the opportunity to drive continual improvement - and this leads to buggy software.
  </p>

  <h3>Why I started building this code...</h3>
  <p>
     Whenever I start a new job or engagement, I always ask whether any shared libraries exist for handling these very common application support needs - perhaps 
     someone has invented the wheel by now.  If such libraries do exist, then I would certainly use them rather the coding something different from scratch and 
     propagating unnecessary variation. But with only one notable exception I have never found what I was looking for and have repeatedly ended up needing to 
     create some of these same capabilities from scratch - yet one more time.
    </p>
    <p>      
     After having this occur a number of times, I decided to start building my own set of operational support libraries and simply "bring my code with me".  I always 
     make sure that the organization is clear about what I'm doing and I always offer to simply give the code to the organization or project.  My intent is merely to 
     preclude the need of building again these common support functions and thus be free to focus on building technology to support the needed business functions, 
     which is the purpose for which I've been hired. 
  </p>
  <p>
     I have written well over a hundred "home projects" (for learning or for a specific purpose) and have done a number of side projects of various sizes across the last
     ten years.  Across this span of time I have continued to build up and perfect this set of reusable components.  Additionally I have also developed a number 
     of "application shells" for desktop applications, Windows Services, web sites, web APIs and WCF web services.  With these "shells" I have a good starting place for applications of 
     various "form factors" and I thus don't have to start from scratch at the higher levels either.  Additionally, there is a set of commonly needed utilities.</p>
  <p>
     Below I provide a discussion of an example application that uses the libraries I've been describing.
  </p><br/>

  <h3>Example - Generic Task Processing Framework</h3>
  <p>
     As one example of an "application shell" which uses several of the operations support libraries discussed above, this section discusses a generic task processing 
     framework that I call "TPFX" (Task Processing Framework). For a high-level view of the functionality of the TPFX, please see the diagram at the bottom of this page.
    </p>
    <p>
     The TPFX has a modular architecture enabling the creation of "modules" that can dynamically "plug" into a run-time "socket".  The modules can perform virtually any function
     that is necessary and the "socket" provides all the run-time support needed by the module.  This architecture makes it very easy to rapidly create new capabilities 
     without having to reinvent all the support needed at run-time.
  </p>
  <p>
     At the "top-level" the TPFX functionality runs as a Windows Service.  The Windows Service can be run in as many instances as needed with each instance running 
     its own set of modules.  You can find the code for the top-level Windows Service application in the "WinService" folder in the "Apps" top level folder 
     in the code repository (click <a href="https://github.com/smbolt/smbolt_git/tree/master/code/CS/Apps" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a> 
     to view the "Apps" folder in the code repository).  
     You'll see that there is very little code in the Windows Service application.  It's actually just a very thin layer between the operating system
     and the high-level libraries that embody the vast majority of the functionality. 
    </p>
    <p> 
     To aid in framework and module development, there is also a desktop application in the "Apps" folder called "WinServiceHost".  WinServiceHost is essentially a 
     "workbench" for the development and testing of the pluggable "modules".  The workbench hosts all the reusable libraries for the task processing service and 
     the operations support functions, and thus serves as a platform for the development and testing of the service and the modules.
     Since Windows Service applications don't support user interfaces (i.e. they run as the background processes controlled by the operating system with 
     no visible components) they can be difficult to develop and test. The WinServiceHost program "hosts" all of the components of the Task Processing Framework 
     and the operations support libraries and therefore makes the development and testing of the framework and the modules much easier.
  </p>
  <p>
     Embodying the entire functionality of the TPFX within high-level libraries and running them inside a desktop application (WinServiceHost) provides for a user 
     interface "surface" for clicking buttons and for viewing a scrolling log of activity and messages as output.  This architecture also allows the WinService 
     application to be the thinnest wrapper between the operating system's Service Control Manager and a rich set of business and operations support functions 
     embodied in the reusable libraries.
  </p>
  <p>
     In addition to the top-level (main-thread-owning) applications mentioned above (WinService and WinServiceHost), a number of reusable (thread-dependent) 
     libraries in the "Libs" folder of the codebase are used by the TPFX (click <a href="https://github.com/smbolt/smbolt_git/tree/master/code/CS/Libs" 
     target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a> to view the "Libs" folder in the code repository).
     This includes high-level components such as in the Org.TSK library (implementing the task engine and task dispatcher), and Org.TSK.Business 
     (the business classes related to task processing, scheduling parameterization, etc.).  Additional lower level libraries include Org.TP (base classes and 
     interfaces for task processors), and Org.Notify (email and SMS notifications).  Finally, as always, at the bottom of the library hierarchy is Org.GS 
     (which a broad array of "general services" - too many to list here) supporting the most commonly required services to all types of applications and 
     mid/lower-level libraries across the codebase). 
  </p>
  <p>
     In the diagram at the bottom of this page, the generic task processing framework is represented by everything that is not colored blue.  The unique, 
     problem-specific task-processing modules which are dynamically loaded at run-time are the items in blue. These "blue modules" are the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">only code that needs 
     to be written</span> to implement a new function (regardless how simple or complex - to this architecture, they are all just "blue modules" that "plug in" 
     to the higher level framework). What this means is that about 95% of the code is generic and completely reusable. This code is also quite well-perfected since 
     it has been used, corrected, optimized, etc. repetitively across several years.
  </p>
  <p>
     To implement a new instance of the task-processing service, you simply copy the executable code for the service to a new directory, run a commmand to create a 
     new Windows Service definition pointing to the main executable, move some "blue modules" (containing the desired business functions) into a subordinate directory 
     (so they can be discovered and loaded at run-time), update an operations control database with the task's schedule, parameters and notification configurations...
     then simply start the service using the operating system's Service Control Manager.  This can be done in less than 30 minutes by someone following directions.  
     It can be done in 10 minutes by someone who has done it before.
  </p>
  <p>
     Building new modules can be done very rapidly because they all adhere to the same, very simple interface and follow a consistent pattern of structure and behavior.  
     There is no need to build anything that outside of the new "blue module".  Scheduling, parameterization, logging, configuration, exception handling, 
     notifications, a multi-threaded engine and more are all part of the very capable run-time "socket" into which the modules are loaded and run. 
  </p> 
  <p>
     With these libraries I can focus on delivering <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">business value</span> instead of having to build  
     <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">again</span> the necessary <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">operational overhead</span> 
     functions for applications.  And from an operations standpoint (concerning security, stability, reliability, performance, threading and much  more), 
     I like to say (because it has been my objective in building this and my experience in multiple environments) it simply "runs like a refrigerator" - by which 
     I mean, it just sits there and hums, doesn't cause any trouble and gets its work done on time. 
  </p> 
  <p> 
     The Task Processing Framework (TPFX) is simply a completely generic and totally reusable framework for automating technology-based business functions. 
     It is completely focused on providing business value by enabling business value-creating modules to be developed very quickly. These value-creating modules thus 
     have a solid "run-time home" and are freed from having to worry about (or even to know about) anything that exists outside of each module's specific 
     <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;"> business value-providing</span> concerns. Everything else is provided by the framework.  
     All of the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;"> opertional</span> requirements have been met in a scope that is fully outside 
     the visibiliy and concerns of the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">business-focused</span> modules. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">This</span> is what I mean when I speak of <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">
    application systems architecture.</span> And this is the kind of design I am referring to when I speak about technology fulfilling its purpose in being totally 
    focused on providing business value.
