    <h3>What I've Been Building</h3>
    <p>
       Across the last 10 years I have been building a codebase for the purpose of rapid application development.  My focus has been on the parts of applications
       that are often thought of last.  It is very natural and necessary to focus on the primary/core functions when developing new applications.
       But most all applications have the need of a several "secondary/supporting functions" such as configuration, logging, encryption, serialization, date processing, 
       interfaces to web services and databases, file processing algorithms, messaging, exception handling, email and SMS notifications, modularity, task 
       processing, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Taken as a whole this set of elements can comprise more than 50% of the total code and functions - sometime much more.  Most of these functions 
       support some aspect of the "operational function" of the technology, not necessarily the primary "business function".  The "business function" pertains to 
       <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">what</span> an application must do.  The "operational function" pertains to 
       <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">how</span> an application accomplishes its primary business function - how it delivers its value. 
    </p>

        <h5>Reusable C# Libraries</h5>
        </a></header>
      <p>A large set of reusable libraries that provide various types of support for multiple types of applications.  A significant 
         amount of commonly needed application functionality is implemented in the "General Services Library" - Org.GS.</p>

  <p>
     My philosophy is that <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">all</span> the business value potential of an application is realized through 
     its <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">operation</span> (when it operates, it produces value) therefore building solid, 
     reusable components that implement the operational aspects of applications is very important to being able to deliver business value.  And, 
     building it <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration: underline;">once</span> as reusable components fosters the kind of reuse, that coupled with 
     the willingess to refactor and make fixes in the right place, produces a very solid and nicely architected set of components and enables the production 
     of high quality applications that are developed rapidly - two things that do not normally go together.
  </p>
  <p>
     It is very common for these "secondary" needs to be built in an ad-hock fashion as a secondary, lower-priority focus of the development process. 
     This typically results in a wide diversity of techniques in solving the the same common set problems or applications that "do without" some of the
     operational support they should have. This diversity leads to minimal reuse and minmal reuse typically cuts off the opportunity to drive continual 
     improvement, which leads to buggy software.
  </p>
  <p>
     Often I when I start a new job or engagement, I would ask whether any libraries exist for handling these very common application support needs -
     because if they do exist I would certainly use them rather the coding something different from scratch and propagating unnecessary variation. But with only 
     one notable exception I never found what I was looking for and ended up needing to create some of these functions (again) from scratch. After having this occur
     a few times decided that I would bring my code with me and give it to the organization or project so that I could stop having to build again these
     common support functions.  
  </p>
  <p>
     As I have done over a hundred "home projects" (for learning or for a specific purpose) and have done a number of side projects of various sizes, I have 
     continued to build up and perfect the components.  Additionally I have also developed a number of "application shells" for desktop applications, Windows 
     Services and WCF web services and a set of commonly needed utilities.  One of these "application shells" is discussed at the bottom of the page.   
  </p><br/>

  <h3>Example - Generic Task Processing Framework</h3>
  <p>
     As an example of an "application shell" that is part of the C# codebase described above, I've placed an architectural overview of a generic task processing framework 
     that I call "TPFX" (Task Processing Framework) in the diagram below.  
  </p>
  <p>
     The diagram below the generic and reusable code is represented by all the elements that are not blue.  The unique task processing modules that are dynamically 
     plugged in at run-time are the items in blue. These "blue modules" are the only code that needs to be written to implement a new function (regarless how simple or complex). 
     Therefore, about 95% of the code is generic and completely reusable. It is also relatively perfected as it has been used, fixed, optimized, etc. repetitively.
  </p>
  <p>
     To implement a new instance of this service, you simply copy the binaries of the service to a new directory, run a PowerShell commmand to point a new Windows Service 
     definition at the main executable, move some "blue modules" into a subordinate directory, update the configuration file to tell the service which tasks to run, update the database 
     to schedule tasks and supply any necessary parameters and configure notifications - then just start the service using the Service Control Manager. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Building new modules can be done very rapidly as they adhere to a very simple interface and follow a consistent pattern of structure and behavior.  And because 
     you don't have to build anything that surrounds the "blue module", scheduling, parameterization, logging, configuration, exception handling, 
     notifications and a multi-threaded engine are all part of the "shell" and are fully reusable. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Now I can focus on delivering business value instead of building again the necessary "overhead" functions of applications.  And from an operations 
     standpoint (stability, reliability, performance, etc.), as I like to say "it runs like a refrigerator" - meaning, it does its job and quietly hums.
