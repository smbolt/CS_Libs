    <h3>At the Point of Inflexion</h3>
    <p>
       In 2009 as CTO of a small but growing medical software company and facing the need to refresh our infrastructure, I recommended to our CEO that we transition the 
       company's systems and data to the cloud.  At that time "taking it to the cloud" would have meant a "lift and shift" to virtual servers. But apparently it was still too 
       early to be comfortable with our data and code being anywhere else but on physical servers that we could see and touch and hear. At the time I was keeping part 
       of a five day rotation of backup tapes in my home office - putting the one I brought home on the bottom of the stack and bringing the one on the top of the stack to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
       I remember a day we when we lost power.  Knowing that our rack-based UPS was not going to hold for long, a colleague hurried to the server room to bring the 
       primary domain controller which was also our file server down in an orderly fashion.  As she was quickly shutting down the old 2003 Server PDC, it politely 
       informed her that it had taken the initiative (probably because we had been neglecting it) to do some things it wanted to do.  It simply said "installing 
       update 1 of 173, please do not turn off your computer".  We quickly ran a long cord from across the parking lot to let it finish the updates and shut down.
    </p>
    <p>
       Even though getting away from another round of on-premise servers was not on the table, I ended up somewhat satisfied that we were able to implement VMware.  
       After our transition, our only physical servers were hosting VMs running Windows 2008 Server, replacing the tired physical servers we had which were running Windows 
       2003 Server.  It was so nice to be able to create a new server in seconds, rather than having to get on the phone with our rep to order another physical box, worrying 
       about getting the details of the configuration just right, waiting for it to arrive, and then spending hours getting in the rack and on the network.
    </p>
    <p>
       Today, nearly eight years later, we seem to be at or near an inflection point where an increasing number of small and midsize companies are becoming more comfortable with putting
       systems and data in the cloud. Obviously, this is a very general statement and each company is in their own unique place concerning this matter. Some have been taking advantage 
       of the cloud for a few years now.  But most of the small to mid-size companies that I've been exposed to have been on a slow approach.  Regardless, there has certainly been 
       a rise in the number of job postings asking for experience with Azure or AWS that there were a year ago which is evidence that such a trend is under way.
    </p>
    <p>
       My belief is that we are likely to see an acceleration in the adoption of cloud-based services among many small and midsize businesses which up to now have seemed to 
       have been somewhat slow to take up this direction. I think that this is a very good thing for a number or reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
       For example, most small and midsize companies do a really poor job of actually having workable plans for business continuity and disaster recovery (actually 
       most larger companies can be lumped into this particular concern too).  Thoughtfully leveraging cloud-based infrastructure can certainly make a key difference in the 
       nature of BC/DR planning because so much comes with the package, and the real risks are different. Additionally, the cloud brings great opportunity to 
       capitalize on a degree of consistency of infrastructure that could never be achieved with premise-based physical servers - and consistency enables greater reuse, 
       which fosters greater perfection of patterns and increased reliability.
    </p>

    <h3 style="padding: 10px 0 4px 0">The Need to Recognize the Significance of the Cloud</h3>
    <p>
       Although there seems to be some general acceleration of cloud adoption, I have yet to see that most companies have much recognition of the kind of difference-making 
       opportunity moving their systems and data could present. For the most part, the movement I've seen hasn't impressed me as having been based on strategic decisions but rather 
       has seemed considerably more arbitrary.  Sometimes the movement is initiated within the technology team or by a vendor in absence of the awareness and purposeful 
       consideration of senior operations management.  If the company's senior team has not given some educated consideration on the matter, they may not recognize when costly decisions 
       are being made that may have significant ramifications if an undesigned propagation of systems and data to the cloud has to be unwound or consolidated.
    </p>
    <p>
       The movement toward the cloud is not a small matter.  It is actually of huge significance where your systems and data are. And in absence of a well thought out 
       plan, a good design and execution, the result cannot be other than an "unplanned" and "poorly designed" technology implementation.  This will end up being very 
       expensive and is likely to perform poorly and be difficult to manage.  It will certainly elongate the hybrid stage and be a poor starting place for what will eventually 
       become the primary platform.  This is really unfortunate and a bit paradoxical, because the very same direction that has been undertaken organically with poor 
       results could have been undertaken in a planned and designed fashion and brought realization of the significant potential benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
       The size and complexity of an organizations technology infrastructure will determine how long transitioning to the cloud will take.  My opinion is that the 
       more quickly an organization can get through the hybrid stage, the more quickly it can capitalize on the stability and homogenous nature of the cloud 
       platform. Significantly larger companies make take a decade or longer to make the transition and thus may have hybrid arrangements for a long time. Eventually, 
       I believe that economics will drive the decision and process. And companies that make and execute good plans will be the ones that capitalize on the benefits 
       and gain the advantage. Unplanned organic growth into the cloud is nearly certain to fail to realize the potential benefits and may simply be an extension 
       of an on-premise mess onto a hybrid platform. I personally believe that a mess can be made pretty much anywhere.
    </p>   

    <h3 style="padding: 10px 0 4px 0">After Cresting the Hill Gravity Will Pull You Forward</h3>
    <p>
       The kind of unplanned organic growth into the cloud mentioned above is what I am referring to in the title - "tipping backward".  If we are indeed at or past 
       a tipping point, which I believe we are, then many of the psychological barriers against putting technology assets in the cloud should be diminishing. 
       I personally have observed this as a general trend across the last couple years. Further, the noticable increase in the number of open job postings looking 
       for cloud experience tells me that we've been passing through this subtle change.  It may be that we have crested the hill. Previously, where there was a force of gravity 
       that was inhibiting us, tugging on us from the direction of premise-based technology. Today it seems that the pull of gravity has shifted and is now pulling 
       us gently but increasingly forward in the direction of cloud-based technology. But we may still be facing the direction of our "premise-based past" rather 
       than the "cloud-based future".  Thus we may essentially be "backing into the cloud" pulled by a subtle gravity in a rather unplanned fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
       Unfortunately, the transition, which I believe all companies will have to make, has the potential to be very messy and expensive. Because of a general lack 
       of understanding of the significance of this change, with its vast opportunities and dangerous pitfalls, many companies may have a long, drawn out and difficult 
       transition which in some cases might threaten their continued existence.  Given enough money and time it is not difficult to make miserable messes with technology -
       and spreading that mess to another platforms will be a natural extension for many companies.
    </p>
    <p>
       I believe that it is important, especially in small and midsize companies that the senior management team responsible for operations get educated on the nature 
       of the transition that is beginning to occur - and get involved enough to ensure that the transition is purposeful, well planned and well executed. 
       The decisions regarding this kind of planned and purposeful approach to the cloud and the initiation, sequence and pace of the movement should begin at the top 
       because the stakes are actually very high.  I'm not saying that top management should be directly involved with the specific design of the technology in the cloud.  
       But I am saying that there should be an informed and purposeful momentum generated from the top and that senior management should work with the technology team
       to develop and execute, in a purposeful, step-wise fashion a planned approach to "cross that bridge" that all companies will have to cross in the coming years.
