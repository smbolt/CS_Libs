    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
       In the sections below my work experience is listed with the most recent information first.  The content is a bit more informal than what would find in my resume. 
       My intention in setting the more casual tone is to provide a natural context for some more inclusive discussion - mainly related to my rationale for choosing to 
       work the organizations or engagements and why I chose to leave.  It also allows me to embed some links to some of the articles I have placed on this site.
    </p>

    <h3>Work History</h3>

    <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Lead Systems Analyst / Solutions Architect</h4>
    <h4><span><a class="orgname" target="_blank" href="http://www.gulfportenergy.com/">Gulfport Energy Corporation</a></span>
        <span>(Oil and Gas Industry) - January 2015 to present</span></h4>
    <p>
       I currently work at Gulfport Energy Corporation where my title is 'Lead Systems Analyst'.  I function as the principle architect and lead developer
       of the company's custom application development. I have a small team of software and SharePoint developers and provide leadership and mentoring for 
       other teams regarding custom application development. I work closely other technology leads and their teams and with various departmental management
       and staff to gather requirements and deliver technology value.

    <h4 class="appindent" style="font-style: italic;">Accomplishments</h4>

    <p class="appindent">
       <span class="appname">Well Master Web Site </span> - An Angular 1.3 web site using a C# Web API 2 backend that provides view and update
       capabilities for wells and related entities in a central database where information is collected and rationalized.
    </p>
    <p class="appindent">
       <span class="appname">Cost Forecasting Desktop App</span> - A highly complex C# WinForms application using 
       <span class="tooltip">MEF<span class="tooltiptext">Microsoft Extensibility Framework</span></span> 
       for modularity and DevExpress components for displaying hierarchical grids of data and supporting exports to Excel files. This application was 
       developed in 2016 for the 2017 budget year. This application provided a huge savings in the assembly and analysis of costs related to drilling, 
       completion and production operations in Ohio. The VP of Operations has asked for the two other department conduction field operations (Louisiana 
       and Oklahoma) to use this application for their 2018 budgeting.

    <p class="appindent">
       <span class="appname">Generic, Windows Service-Based Task Processing Engine</span> - A multi-threaded Windows Service built with C# 4.5 and leveraging 
       <span class="tooltip">MEF<span class="tooltiptext">Microsoft Extensibility Framework</span></span> for loading pluggable modules that perform
       task processing functionality. This 'task processing service/engine' has been deployed in multiple instances with each instance being responsible
       for hosting various types of 'task processing modules'. This 'generic framework' with clean separation between the 'task processing engine' and the individual
       'task processing modules' has saved significant development effort since only the 'pluggable modules' need to be built when new work is required. 
       Modules can be built for just about any imaginable task and they all run in a completely consistent generic framework.
    </p>
    <p class="appindent">
       The generic task processing service and the over 20 task processing modules deployed so far make use of a database for scheduling, parameterization, and
       configuration <span class="tooltip">WCF<span class="tooltiptext">Windows Communication Framework</span></span> web service requests which are processed by similar 
       pluggable 'request processing modules'. A separate C# WinForms desktop application called the 'OpsManager' is used to create and update schedules and parameters.

    <h4 class="appindent" style="font-style: italic;">Current Projects</h4>

    <p class="appindent">
       <span class="appname">Implementation of CygNet SCADA System for Ohio </span> - I am currently heavily involved with the implementation of the CygNet SCADA
       System for Gulfport's Ohio assets. Of particular focus for me has been the consideration of hosting options as we currently have a number of systems on premise
       and others being hosted by various cloud-based technology providers. I have also been heavily invovled with infrastructure planning and implementation
       and ensuring that we are prepared for the systems stringent operational requirements and can also support both planned infrastructure and application maintenance
       and unplanned operational issues.
    </p>

    <p class="appindent">
       <span class="appname">Text Processing Workbench </span> - I am currently developing a 'Text Processing Workbench' which will be used to extract raw text
       from PDF documents and determine, through text pattern recognition, whether the document is of a recognized type.  For recognized documents, additional functionality
       based in a configurable command language (also developed by me) will first impose a hierarchical structure upon the text (as many hierarchical layers as desired), and then 
       extract the desired text values from each hierarchical node and create a format-configurable output XML document.  The Text Processing Workbench has been 
       designed to allow non-programmers to develop document recognition configurations and text extraction configurations for any PDF file which will be used as a 
       source for data collection. The workbench utilizes modular text-processing components that be embedded in other applications to automate the extraction of valuable
       data from PDF files and support downstream integration.
