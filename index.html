    <p>I have had a long and successful career in software development. I am essentially an architect and systems builder. I believe in 
        the importance of understanding technology from a top-down perspectve and making sure that good high-level design is in place.
        Any system that is lacking a good top-level design will have much difficulty compensating for that lack at the lower levels.
        I also believe that technology systems should be well-aligned with the business processes they enable and support. The meaning
        of technology is found in the business value they provide. And systems should always provide a gateway to the future, 
        anticipating, enabling and facilitating progress and should never be impediments to progress.

    <p>
       I have put up these few pages for the purpose of establishing a place where I post some articles and expose some of the code I have been writing for
       the past ten years.  Click the button below to see the page where there is a description of the code and why I started developing it.  There you will
       also find links into the GitHub repository where I have placed some of the code.  The repository contains over 120,000 lines of C# code. There are a 
       number of generic application shells and several common utilities that I have developed plus over 40 reusable modules in the form of C# libraries.

    <h3>Tipping Backwards into the Cloud</h3>
    <p>
       In 2009 as CTO of a small but growing medical software company and facing the need to refresh our infrastructure, I recommended to our CEO that we transition the 
       company's systems and data to the cloud.  At that time "taking it to the cloud" would have meant a "lift and shift" to virtual servers. But apparently it was still too 
       early to be comfortable with our data and code being anywhere else but on physical servers that we could see and touch and hear. At the time I was keeping part 
       of a five day rotation of backup tapes in my home office - putting the one I brought home on the bottom of the stack and bringing the one on the top of the stack to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
       I remember a day we when we lost power.  Knowing that our rack-based UPS was not going to hold for long, a colleague hurried to the server room to bring the 
       primary domain controller which was also our file server down in an orderly fashion.  As she was quickly shutting down the old 2003 Server PDC, it politely 
       informed her that it had taken the initiative (probably because we had been neglecting it) to do some things it wanted to do.  It simply said "installing 
       update 1 of 173, please do not turn off your computer".  We quickly ran a long cord from across the parking lot to let it finish the updates and shut down.
    </p>
    <p>
       Even though getting away from another round of on-premise servers was not on the table, I ended up somewhat satisfied that we were able to implement VMware.  
       After our transition, our only physical servers were hosting VMs running Windows 2008 Server, replacing the tired physical servers we had which were running Windows 
       2003 Server.  It was so nice to be able to create a new server in seconds, rather than having to get on the phone with our rep to order another physical box, worrying 
       about getting the details of the configuration just right, waiting for it to arrive, and then spending hours getting in the rack and on the network.
