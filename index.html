    <p>Technology should find its primary value in the automation of key business processes. We should not look to technology to have inherent value in itself or apart from
        its effectiveness and efficiency in serving the business.  Technology should always be a nimble and adaptable enabler and never an impediment.

    <h3>Tipping Backwards into the Cloud</h3>
    <p>
       In 2009 as CTO of a small but growing medical software company and facing the need to refresh our infrastructure, I recommended to our CEO that we transition the 
       company's systems and data to the cloud.  At that time "taking it to the cloud" would have meant a "lift and shift" to virtual servers. But apparently it was still too 
       early to be comfortable with our data and code being anywhere else but on physical servers that we could see and touch and hear. At the time I was keeping part 
       of a five day rotation of backup tapes in my home office - putting the one I brought home on the bottom of the stack and bringing the one on top to the office.
    </p>
    <p>
       I remember the day we lost power and knowing our rack-based UPS was not going to hold for long. A colleague hurried to the server room to try to bring the PDC down
       in a orderly fashion.  As she was quickly shutting down the old 2003 Server it politely informed her that it was installing update 1 of 173.  We had to run a long
       cord from across the parking lot to let it finish the updates and shut down.
    </p>
    <p>
       Even though getting away from another round of on-premise servers was out of the question, I ended up satisfied that we were able to implement VMware.  
       After our transition, our only physical servers were hosting VMs running Windows 2008 Server, replacing the tired physical servers we had which were running Windows 
       2003 Server.  It was so nice to be able to create a new server in seconds, rather than having to get on the phone with our rep to order another physical box, worrying 
       about getting the details of the configuration just right, waiting for it to arrive, and then spending hours getting in the rack and on the network.
